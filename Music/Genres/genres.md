## What is Regional Mexican?
### refers collectively to the regional subgenres of the country music of Mexico and its derivatives from the Southwestern United States. Each subgenre is representative of a certain region and its popularity also varies by regions. Subgenres include banda, country en Español, Duranguense, grupero, mariachi, New Mexico music, Norteño, Sierreño, Tejano, and Tierra Caliente. It is among the most popular radio formats targeting Mexican Americans in the United States.

## Time Line:
- ### 1940s - 1960s: Rise of Mariachi
    - Pedro Infante was one of many who helped popularize the genre in the 1950s during the Golden Age of Mexican Cinema.
    - Mariachi is an ensemble of musicians that typically play ranchera, the regional Mexican music dating back to at least the 18th century, evolving over time in the countryside of various regions of western Mexico.[1] The usual mariachi group today consists of as many as eight violins, two trumpets and at least one guitar, including a high-pitched vihuela and an acoustic bass guitar called a guitarrón, and all players taking turns singing lead and doing backup vocals.

- ### 1970s – 1980s: Popularity of Mariachi
    - This style began to increasingly spread into the United States. Many popular mariachi singers during this time include Vicente Fernández and  Juan Gabriel.
    - Mariachi music became more popular in the United States in the 1970s as it spread into the country from Mexico. Mariachi music was featured in churches and schools, and at concerts, festivals, and conferences.

## 2024 Latin GRAMMYs: Album Of The Year Nominations
### The 2024 Latin GRAMMYs, artists will compete in two new Categories this year, including Best Contemporary Mexican Music Album.

### The new Category, housed within the Regional Mexican Field, highlights six albums showcasing a rich diversity of Mexican genres. This year’s nominees are Nata Montana by Natanael Cano, DannyLux’s Evoluxion, *Jugando A Que No Pasa Nada from Grupo Frontera*, Carín León’s Boca Chueca, Vol. 1, Trastornado by Michelle Maciel, and Peso Pluma’s Génesis. The Best Contemporary Mexican Music Album Category reflects the worldwide spread and evolution of Mexican music, and its inaugural nominees embody a generation transforming traditional Mexican sounds and expanding the genre's legacy far and wide.

## Rise of Regional Mexican Music
#### Leila Cobo, Billboard’s chief content officer for Latin music coverage, always believed Mexican music was going to be huge in the U.S., given its large Mexican American population.
#### “But I never, in a million years, thought it was going to become so global,” she says.

#### For Cobo, one of the factors contributing to regional Mexican music’s global reach is streaming, which democratized listening habits and allowed listeners who might not otherwise come across this music to fall in love with it.

#### On Spotify, Mexican music grew 400% worldwide over the last five years, according to Uriel Waizel, lead editor at Spotify Mexico. And on YouTube, Peso Pluma bested Taylor Swift and Bad Bunny to become 2023’s most streamed artist on the platform.

### A MOVEMENT, NOT A MOMENT
#### For Grammy-winning producer Édgar Barrera, to understand regional Mexican music, listeners must first understand that “it is a movement” finally having its “moment to shine globally,” because regional Mexican artists now encompass a variety of genres and sounds.

#### He cites the cumbias of Grupo Frontera and the corridos tumbados of Peso Pluma, both with very different lyrical approaches: “And they are doing numbers that the American artists are doing.”
#### Artists like Frontera, Fuerza Regida and Junior H are selling out “the same venues that Drake goes to a week later,” he says.

#### Barrera believes part of the cross-border appeal is that these regional Mexican genres are founded in live instrumental performance — guitars, tubas, trombones, trumpets and more.

#### “They are real musicians, they are people making real music, not a computer where you are programming or grabbing something from a sound library,” he says.

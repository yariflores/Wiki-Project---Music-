> ## What is a subgenre?
### A *subgenre* is a subordinate within a genre. In music terms, it is a subcategory of a musical genre that adopts its basic characteristics, but also has its own set of characteristics that clearly distinguish and set it apart within the genre. A subgenre is also often being referred to as a style of the genre. The proliferation of popular music in the 20th century has led to over 1,200 definable subgenres of music.

| Sub-Genre | Explination|
| ---------------| --------|
| Regional Mexican  | Refers collectively to the regional subgenres of the country music of Mexico and its derivatives from the Southwestern United States. Each subgenre is representative of a certain region and its popularity also varies by regions. |
| Latin Pop | Is a pop music subgenre that is a fusion of US–style music production with Latin music genres from anywhere in Latin America and Spain. Originating with Spanish-speaking musicians. |

### Music has been divided into many different genres throughout history, following a range of criteria. Streaming service Spotify has around 1,300 music genres, helping to break down millions of songs with a range of sounds, patterns and structures.

### First and foremost, they help us to organise a huge amount of music so it’s easier for us to locate and identify it. It helps us identify the genre of a song we like, and listen to more like it. On the other hand, if you hear a song in a genre you hate, you can avoid that. 

### This categorisation goes beyond the individual. It helps record stores to have some structure in what they sell. It helps music award shows like The Grammys to represent nominees and winners from across the industry. 

### Genres are also hugely important to culture. Being a big fan of a specific genre of music can help us feel involved in something bigger than ourselves. It can influence the way we dress, the way we speak, the people we’re friends with. They can bond fans and listeners, and facilitate shared experiences.

> ## How have they changed over the years?

### One of the reasons the world of genres has changed is technology, whether it's advances in the way music can be recorded, musical equipment or the effects musicians can use. Just take the development of equipment like synthesizers giving rise to EDM in the 1990s and 2000s, the invention of the electric guitar in the 1930s changing the Rock and Roll world, or even apps like Tik Tok gaining huge popularity in recent years and consequently driving certain genres to become viral.

### Another influence on music genres is the political environment surrounding them. For example the Civil Rights movement gave rise to genres like Soul and Hip-Hop, right through to the 21st century where things like social justice and climate change are crucial in modern genres like Grime.

### Going back to the idea that music genres are important to culture and identity, they can also change with social trends. Whether you think of the hippie movement in the 1960s and 1970s, the disco era of the 1970s, the grunge scene in the 1990s or even emo culture in the early 2000s, they're all backed up by music genres gaining popularity at the time.

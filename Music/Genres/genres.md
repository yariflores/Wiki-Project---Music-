## What is Regional Mexican?
### refers collectively to the regional subgenres of the country music of Mexico and its derivatives from the Southwestern United States. Each subgenre is representative of a certain region and its popularity also varies by regions. Subgenres include banda, country en Español, Duranguense, grupero, mariachi, New Mexico music, Norteño, Sierreño, Tejano, and Tierra Caliente. It is among the most popular radio formats targeting Mexican Americans in the United States.

## Time Line:
- ### 1940s - 1960s: Rise of Mariachi
    - Pedro Infante was one of many who helped popularize the genre in the 1950s during the Golden Age of Mexican Cinema.
    - Mariachi is an ensemble of musicians that typically play ranchera, the regional Mexican music dating back to at least the 18th century, evolving over time in the countryside of various regions of western Mexico.[1] The usual mariachi group today consists of as many as eight violins, two trumpets and at least one guitar, including a high-pitched vihuela and an acoustic bass guitar called a guitarrón, and all players taking turns singing lead and doing backup vocals.

    - This style began to increasingly spread into the United States. Many popular mariachi singers during this time include Vicente Fernández and  Juan Gabriel.

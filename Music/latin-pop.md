## What is Latin Pop?
### Latin Pop is the necessary subgenre to Pop that offers flavour and rhythm to a genre that can occasionally over-synthesise tunes and lack musical diversity. The history of this music style can be categorised as a subgenre combining classic Pop with Latin American and Caribbean roots.

### It is typically associated with countries such as, ‘Mexico, Colombia, Brazil, Cuba, Puerto Rico and Argentina’1. This subgenre can be difficult to pinpoint its takeover of the American music scene but once it arrived – it was here to stay. Pop’s high pace merges well with the rhythmic elements often found in music originating from Latin America and can allow songs to maintain a steady base rhythm without becoming too repetitive. Some may look towards artists such as Ricky Martin and Enrique Iglesias as their figureheads for the rise of Latin Pop within the western world, although whilst they are major contributors, we can potentially dive earlier into the musical history books.

## History
### Latin pop is one of the most popular Latin music genres today. However, before the arrival of artists like Alejandro Sanz, Thalía, Luis Miguel, Selena, Paulina Rubio, Shakira, Carlos Vives, Ricky Martin, Gloria Trevi and Enrique Iglesias, Latin pop first reached a global audience through the work of bandleader Sergio Mendes in the mid-1960s,[5] although artists like Carmen Miranda popularized Latin samba music in Hollywood decades before this. In later decades, it was defined by the romantic ballads that legendary artists such as Julio Iglesias or Roberto Carlos produced in the 1970s.

### Ricky Martin is considered to be the King of Latin Pop.

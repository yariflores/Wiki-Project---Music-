# Breakdancing

## How did breaking start and who created it?
>Breaking was created by African-American and Latino youths in the Bronx borough of New York City in the 1970s when hip-hop culture was coming to life. A DJ called Kool Herc was throwing neighborhood parties where he noticed young people would go off on the dance floor, moving with more sporadic and dynamic energy, whenever the break of the tracks he was playing would come in. The ‘break’ being the part of the song where all vocals and other instruments would drop out, only leaving the percussion section.

## How breaking amassed media attention and worldwide exposure
>All through the 1970s, breaking spread throughout the New York City boroughs. Soon promoters and the media started to take notice of the b-boys and b-girls they saw dancing at parties, in parks and in clubs. Breaking then started to get exposure to the world through a number of means and opportunities that the breakers were presented with. In 1982, Rock Steady crew went on the Roxxy European Hip-Hop tour, performing on stages in London and Paris. They also appeared on the popular American talkshow, Letterman, in 1983. The New City Breakers appeared on a TV show pilot called Graffiti Rock in 1984 and performed in Washington D.C. for President Ronald Reagan – during the 1984 Kennedy Center Honors – which was broadcast nationally.B-boys and b-girls also appeared in music videos and Hollywood movies, which greatly increased breaking’s exposure to the world. Classic movies people first saw breaking in were: Flashdance (1983), Breakin’ the Movie (1984) and Beat Street (1984), which opens with an iconic crew battle in the Roxxy club.

## The basic elements of breaking
### The basic elements that make up the dance of breaking and that breakers perform while following the snare of the music are:

- Toprock: When breakers are dancing while standing before they go to the floor. Some basic top rock steps are Indian step and Cross step.
- Go downs: The moves breakers use to go from top rock down to the floor. Some basic go downs are knee drops or spin downs.
- Footwork: When breakers are dancing on the floor, using their hands for support as they move their legs through a variety of footwork steps and patterns. Some basic footwork steps are six-step, three-step and CCs.
- Freezes: When breakers go into and hold a solid shape with their body for a few seconds. Some basic breaking freezes are the baby freeze, chair freeze and elbow freeze.

- Power moves: When breakers dynamically propel their whole body into a continuous spinning move with rotational force. Examples of power moves are head spins, air flares and windmills.
- Tricks: When breakers take a conventional breaking step, freeze or power move and add an unconventional dimension and twist to it. Examples of this are the hopping air chairs, or leg threading while doing hand hops.
- Transitions: Transitions are the movements breakers use to connect their footwork, freezes, tricks and power moves. Some basic transitions are sweeps, pretzels and spins.

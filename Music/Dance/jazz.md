# **Jazz**

> Origins of Jazz dance can be traced all the way back to the first years of the arrival of African slaves to the shores of Central and North America. Dances and music they brought were much more free-flowing, experimental and improvisational than traditional dances that were brought to North America by European immigrants. These heavily rhythmic-based and tribal dances had a feature that was described by historians and music experts as almost “conversation-like” qualities, in which both the dancers and music players reacted one to another, creating free-flowing music that enchanted them completely.

## FUN FACT

### A symbiotic relationship
> Authentic Jazz dance is intimately tied to the music and changes as the musical styles and patterns change. One cannot dance a '20s Charleston to a swinging Lionel Hampton track, for example.While we cannot be sure which came first, musicians and dancers rehearsed and worked together developing their art in a symbiotic way. The cutting contests and jam sessions between jazz musicians, for example, is reflected in the jam circles of social dancers.However, when jazz moved away from the dance focus of the swing era to the ‘bebop’ or ‘modern’ era, the social dances could not follow. The complexities and subtleties of partnered and rhythm dancing of the jazz swing-era were lost to the simplistic, if fun, Jive, Rock 'n' Roll, Twist and increasingly solo styles.

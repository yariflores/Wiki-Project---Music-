# **Jarabe Tapatio**

## **History**

>he word jarabe (from Arabic xarab), meaning "syrup", denotes the combination of various Mexican musics (sones) and dances (zapateados). The word Tapatío meaning "hat" is the popular demonym of the city of Guadalajara in Jalisco province and reflects the origin of this particular jarabe. A number of other dances known as jarabes are known to have existed in the 18th and 19th centuries, such as the jarabe de Jalisco, the jarabe de atole and the jarabe moreliano, but the tapatío version is by far the best known. Most of these other jarabes differ from the tapatío in terms of their regional origin throughout Mexico.This is because overall, jarabe is considered much more of a musical and folk dance genre, as opposed to one rigid definition. There is some dispute as to the jarabe tapatío's authenticity as folk dance. Music researcher Nicolás Puentes Macías from Zacatecas states that true jarabes are almost extinct in Mexico, found today only in small fractions of Zacatecas and Jalisco, and that the jarabe tapatío is really a form of a dance called "tonadilla". In addition to this, the dance's origins are also somewhat disputed, either being wholly indigenous or Hispanic in nature Some academics tend to stick to one narrative or the other, but across the board the dance is considered a truly Mestizo creation.

## **Performance**

>The dance represents the courtship of a man and a woman, with the woman first rejecting the man's advances, then eventually accepting them.It has a definite sexual component in metaphor, which was the original reason for disapproval by authorities.As the dance has lost its controversial status and gained status as a representative of Mexico, the dancers have come to wear garb that is also highly representative of Mexican women and men.For women, the most traditional outfit is called the "China Poblana." The blouse and skirt combination is named after a woman from India who came to Mexico on the Manila Galleon to work as a servant in the early 19th century. Her Asian dress was copied and then adapted in the State of Puebla, with the skirt now heavily embroidered and otherwise decorated with patriotic images. The traditional outfit for men is that of the charro, generally heavily decorated in silver trim.

## **Costumes**

- The typical male and female costumes to dance it were used one hundred years apart from each other. The China Poblana was the female servant outfit of the early to mid 1800's. The charro suit decorated with silver buttons, came about with the emergence of the Mariachi around 1930 after going through numerous evolutions, from the hacienda supervisors to the modern urban musicians.

- **Mexican "Chinas"**
Many legends have been attached to the China (Pronounced cheena) outfit, including the romantic story about the oriental princess sold as a slave in the city of Puebla, who then fell in love with a Creole, and created her wedding gown based on the local fashions but decorated with oriental motifs.The truth behind the costume is that every three months a ship carrying goods from the Philippines known as "Nao de China" (Ship from China), anchored in Acapulco. The aristocratic ladies purchased a textile known as "castor" to make skirts for their female servants, called "Chinita" or "china". The word is completely disassociated from any Oriental background. As the length of this fabric was not enough to reach the floor, an addition of silk was sewn at the top of the skirt to complete the length.

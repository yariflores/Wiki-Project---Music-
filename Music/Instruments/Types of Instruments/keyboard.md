# Keyboard Instruments

### Piano
Due to its ability to play harmonies and melodies, the piano is an important instrument in many styles of music. Itâ€™s also one of the most favorite instruments among youngsters who are learning to play. You can hear its magnificent sounds in many genres: classical, jazz, pop, rock, blues, soul, contemporary, and experimental music, where it is either accompanied or played as a solo instrument. The piano is favored for its ability to add depth to the musical compositions, enrich them with emotional layers, unique textures, and thrilling sounds. This is a perfect instrument to show improvisational skills, as it happens in jazz where pianists are great improvisators. The piano is also present in film soundtracks since it helps the composers evoke different emotions and enhance the cinematic experience.

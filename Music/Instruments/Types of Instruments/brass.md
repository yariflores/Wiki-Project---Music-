# Brass Instruments

> It is important to understand the history of brass instruments as an educator for a few reasons. First, students will come to you with questions and strange instruments from the back of closets, and a basic understanding of history will allow you to better respond to the gnarled family tree that makes up brass instruments. Second, the history of an instrument will help you to understand the musical role of the instrument and why it functions as it does in various ensembles today. Third, learning the history of brass assists you with understanding the technical and physical limitations and advantages of the instrument. Finally, knowing the history of an instrument helps you to understand the literature that is available for the instrument.

## Types of Brass Instruments
| Name | Images | Description |
| ---- | ------ | ----------- |
| Trumpet | ![trumpet](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b2cbf1fa-ea52-4a3b-b2d6-031cbb8a7b9a) | The trumpet is constructed of brass tubing bent twice into a rounded oblong shape. As with all brass instruments, sound is produced by blowing air through slightly separated lips, producing a "buzzing" sound into the mouthpiece and starting a standing wave vibration in the air column inside the trumpet. |
| Trombone | ![trombone](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a5e52fb1-e323-44fb-9c5a-b97c3fecfaa4) | The bass trombone is a slide trombone with two valves that are operated by the left thumb. The valves make it possible to lower the instrument's pitch from Bb to F or D. The entire chromatic scale only becomes available thanks to the thumb valve (F tuning) and an additional third-valve (D tuning). |
| Tuba | ![tuba](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/44efcb89-41c0-48c3-8673-a86a23112b04) | Tuba, deep-pitched brass wind instrument with valves and wide conical bore. The word tuba originally was the name of a straight-built Roman trumpet and was the medieval Latin word for trumpet. Valved bass brass instruments for bands are mentioned as early as 1829, but little is now known about them. |
| French Horn | ![french-horn](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2096872d-48b7-4412-bc90-99e2505a50b5) | The French Horn, known popularly as just "the horn," is a brass instrument with a circular shape, wide bell, and rotary valves. The valves direct the player's air through different lengths of tubing, creating more space for air and lowering the pitch that comes out of the bell. |

### Fun Facts
1. Brass is a metal that is yellow in color and is made of copper and zinc. Brass is used for these instruments because it is stronger and harder then copper, but not as strong as steel, so it is easy to form into different shapes.
2. There are instruments made of brass that do not belong to the brass family, like the saxophone.
3. Brass instruments have a mouthpiece that the player blows into. Their lips vibrate with the air and that is what creates the sound or pitch. To change the pitch, the player either presses on valves or uses the slide, as in the case of the trombone.
4. Trumpets date back to around 1500 BC. These trumpets were used for military and religious purposes.
5. The trombone was introduced to the world in the famous 5th Symphony, by Ludwig van Beethoven.

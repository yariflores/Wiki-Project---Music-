| Saxophone | ![saxophone](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e0fafb8d-050d-4609-b308-574fcaff0519) | Invented by Adolphe Sax in the early 1840s, it has become one of the most iconic and versatile instruments. The saxophone is characterized by great music adaptability and the ability to seamlessly blend into different musical genres, so it finds its place in various music contexts, including soulful, melodic, bold and brassy pieces. Today, it’s extremely popular in jazz, blues, rock, pop, classic and funk. Its unique sounds captivate listeners across diverse musical landscapes, making this instrument one of the most popular in the world of music. |
| Flute | ![flute](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/19f9d016-9126-4d67-af6c-9bd79d94f3c9) | Woodwind instrument in which the sound is produced by blowing against a sharp edge. In its broad sense, a flute may be end-blown, like the recorder, or may have a globular shape, like the ocarina. In its narrow sense, discussed below, flute refers to the transverse flute of Western music. |
| Clarinet | ![clarinet](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2474f5a9-e984-451f-8872-64bc94b1320b) | A clarinet is a woodwind instrument. A clarinet has a simple, straight tube with intricate keys, a single-reed mouthpiece, and a flared, bell-shaped end. When you play the clarinet, you blow through the mouthpiece and make notes with your fingers on the keys. |
| Bassoon | ![bassoon](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3c11912e-79ce-46a7-a6b5-def258e38e10) | The bassoon is a woodwind instrument that produces sound in a low range, using a double reed, and has a distinctive shape, with a long tube that looks as though it has been folded in two. |

### Facts
1. The Flute is the oldest of all woodwinds dating back over 30,000 years and has been made from bones, wood, stone, or clay throughout history.  Today’s flutes are typically made from nickel, brass, silver, or wood.
2. Saxophone, it was originally invented as an orchestral instrument in the 19th century.  Made from metal, the saxophone requires a reed to make sound, thereby making it a woodwind instrument.
3.  the Clarinet has only been around since the 18th century.  Early clarinets were made of boxwood.  Professionally, today’s clarinets are made from African hardwoods while beginners can easily find clarinets made from plastic resin.
4.  A shorter version of the flute is called the piccolo, which means small in Italian. At half the size of a standard flute, piccolos play the highest notes of all the woodwinds; in the orchestra one of the flute players will also play piccolo if that instrument is required. The high piping sound of the piccolo is also heard in traditional drum corps and marching band music.
5.  The oboe is a 2 foot long black cylinder with metal keys covering its holes, and its mouthpiece uses a double reed, which vibrates when you blow through it.

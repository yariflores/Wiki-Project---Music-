## Types of Percussion Instruments
| Name | Images | Description |
| ----- | ------ | ---------- |
| Timpani |  | a large hemispherical brass or copper percussion instrument with a drumhead that can be tuned by adjusting the tension on it. |
| Xylophone |  | The xylophone is a musical instrument in the percussion family that consists of wooden bars struck by mallets. Like the glockenspiel, the xylophone essentially consists of a set of tuned wooden keys arranged in the fashion of the keyboard of a piano. |
| Cymbals |  | Often used in pairs, cymbals consist of thin, normally round plates of various alloys. The majority of cymbals are of indefinite pitch, although small disc-shaped cymbals based on ancient designs sound a definite note (such as crotales). |
| Bass drum |  | the largest and deepest-sounding member of the drum family, usually played with a pair of large felt-headed sticks, or beaters. In modern popular-music bands the bass drum is often part of a drum set and is commonly struck by a single pedal-operated stick. |

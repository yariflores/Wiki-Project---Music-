## What are instruments?
> A musical instrument is a device created or adapted to make musical sounds. In principle, any object that produces sound can be considered a musical instrumentâ€”it is through purpose that the object becomes a musical instrument. A person who plays a musical instrument is known as an instrumentalist.

## Short History
> Musical instrument, any device for producing a musical sound. The principal types of such instruments, classified by the method of producing sound, are percussion, stringed, keyboard, wind, and electronic. Musical instruments are almost universal components of human culture: archaeology has revealed pipes and whistles in the Paleolithic Period and clay drums and shell trumpets in the Neolithic Period. It has been firmly established that the ancient city cultures of Mesopotamia, the Mediterranean, India, East Asia, and the Americas all possessed diverse and well-developed assortments of musical instruments, indicating that a long previous development must have existed. As to the origin of musical instruments, however, there can be only conjecture. Some scholars have speculated that the first instruments were derived from such utilitarian objects as cooking pots (drums) and hunting bows (musical bows); others have argued that instruments of music might well have preceded pots and bows; while in the myths of cultures throughout the world the origin of music has frequently been attributed to the gods, especially in areas where music seems to have been regarded as an essential component of the ritual believed necessary for spiritual survival.

### Types of Instruments

| Type | Description |
| ---- | ----- |
| [Brass](brass.md) | A brass instrument is a musical instrument that produces sound by sympathetic vibration of air in a tubular resonator in sympathy with the vibration of the player's lips. Brass instruments are also called labrosones or labrophones, from Latin and Greek elements meaning 'lip' and 'sound'. |
| [Keyboard](keyboard.md) | A keyboard instrument is a musical instrument played using a keyboard, a row of levers that are pressed by the fingers. The most common of these are the piano, organ, and various electronic keyboards, including synthesizers and digital pianos. |
| [Percussion](percussion.md) | A percussion instrument is defined as a musical instrument (including the drum, xylophone, and maraca) sounded by striking, shaking, or scraping. Percussion instruments are made of many different materials, such as wood, plastic, or metal, and they come in all shapes and sizes. |
| [String](string.md) | A string instrument is a musical instrument that produces sound by means of vibrating strings. The most common string instruments in the string family are guitar, electric bass, violin, viola, cello, double bass, banjo, mandolin, ukulele, and harp. | 
| [Woodwind](woodwind.md) | They are all basically narrow cylinders or pipes, with holes, an opening at the bottom end and a mouthpiece at the top. You play them by blowing air through the mouthpiece (that's the "wind" in "woodwind") and opening or closing the holes with your fingers to change the pitch. |

![taylor-swift (1)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8ca9d6b0-af5d-4008-80d7-a4803d07ca32)

> #### Multitalented singer-songwriter and global superstar who has captivated audiences with her heartfelt lyrics and catchy melodies, solidifying herself as one of the most influential artists in contemporary music. Swift showed an interest in music at an early age, and she progressed quickly from roles in children’s theater to her first appearance before a crowd of thousands. She was age 11 when she sang “The Star-Spangled Banner” before a Philadelphia 76ers basketball game, and the following year she picked up the guitar and began to write songs. Taking her inspiration from country music artists such as Shania Twain and the Dixie Chicks (now the Chicks), Swift crafted original material that reflected her experiences of tween alienation. When she was 13, Swift’s parents sold their farm in Pennsylvania to move to Hendersonville, Tennessee, so she could devote more of her time to courting country labels in nearby Nashville.

> #### Following the release of “Drivers License” in January 2021, the High School Musical: The Musical: The Series actress seemingly started the first love triangle of 2021, and the internet was shook. At the time, fans were convinced that the songstress shaded her rumored ex-boyfriend and costar, and his new girlfriend, Sabrina. Although their relationship was never confirmed, HSMTMTS viewers were convinced that Olivia and Joshua were more than friends when the show premiered in November 2019. With “Drivers License,” the former Disney Channel star dropped a few hints that things were less than perfect between her and Joshua.

> #### A Scottish electronic band from Glasgow, formed in 2011. The group consists of Lauren Mayberry (lead vocals, occasionally synths and samplers), Iain Cook (synths, guitar, bass, vocals) and Martin Doherty (synths, samplers, vocals). The group's debut album, The Bones of What You Believe, was released on 20 September 2013. Previously, Mayberry was a member of the bands Boyfriend/Girlfriend and Blue Sky Archives. Mayberry is a trained drummer and also did a four-year law degree, followed by a Masters in journalism. Cook was a member of Aereogramme and The Unwinding Hours and also wrote music for film and TV. Doherty was a live member of The Twilight Sad. According to Mayberry, "Iain and Martin went to university together so they've known each other for quite a long time". The band started in October 2011 as a studio project between the long time friends Iain Cook and Martin Doherty. Cook already knew Lauren Mayberry from working with Blue Sky Archives and suggested her as a potential vocalist for the project.

> #### What began as accusations that Hailey “stole” Justin from Gomez quickly spiraled out of control as social media users picked apart every post made by these grown women in search of proof of their feud or of Hailey Baldwin’s alleged obsession with Jelena. No matter what either woman did to shut down the online hate—including posing together at an event in October 2022—fans continued to speculate for years. 
Many thought the drama started because Hailey was jealous of Selena and Justin's former relationship, and others thought it was because they just simply don't get along. It began when fans assumed Hailey was throwing shade at Selena with a TikTok she posted and then quickly deleted.

| ----- | ------ | ---------- |
| Timpani | ![timpani](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8f2679ee-6bc9-41e1-aed8-95a3b358b8ef) | a large hemispherical brass or copper percussion instrument with a drumhead that can be tuned by adjusting the tension on it. |
| Xylophone | ![xylophone](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4011c424-fedc-4364-9a95-64ac9b5061cb) | The xylophone is a musical instrument in the percussion family that consists of wooden bars struck by mallets. Like the glockenspiel, the xylophone essentially consists of a set of tuned wooden keys arranged in the fashion of the keyboard of a piano. |
| Cymbals | ![cymbals](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/53235133-ebee-415a-bc39-63ffdde15230) | Often used in pairs, cymbals consist of thin, normally round plates of various alloys. The majority of cymbals are of indefinite pitch, although small disc-shaped cymbals based on ancient designs sound a definite note (such as crotales). |
| Bass drum | ![bass-drum](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d35cddc3-ae88-4ee1-8356-067e3e305ec6) | the largest and deepest-sounding member of the drum family, usually played with a pair of large felt-headed sticks, or beaters. In modern popular-music bands the bass drum is often part of a drum set and is commonly struck by a single pedal-operated stick. |

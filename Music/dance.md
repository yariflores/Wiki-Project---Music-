# **History Dance**

## **Dance**
>Dancing to rhythmic music has long been a cherished tradition in both Western and Eastern African civilizations, where dynamic movements synchronized with percussion instruments such as drums, bells, and rattles serve as integral expressions of cultural identity, social cohesion, and spiritual significance.While there exist attestations of the combination of dance and music in ancient times (for example Ancient Greek vases sometimes show dancers accompanied by musicians), the earliest Western dance music that we can still reproduce with a degree of certainty are the surviving medieval dances such as carols and the Estampie. The earliest of these surviving dances are almost as old as Western staff-based music notation.

 ### There are several notable ages in the history of dance, including:

- **1900s–1910s** During the early 20th century, **ballroom** dancing gained popularity among the working class who attended public dance halls.

 - **1920s Jazz Age** Dance music became enormously popular during the 1920s. Nightclubs were frequented by large numbers of people at which a form of jazz, which was characterized by fancy orchestras with strings instruments and complex arrangements, became the standard music at clubs. A particularly popular dance was the fox-trot. At the time this music was simply called jazz, although today people refer to it as "white jazz" or big band. Marabi evolved in South Africa in the 1920s, rooted in South African folk music, ragtime, jazz and blues. People were able to dance endlessly without having to have been familiar with the songs being played, before.

 - **The 1930’s**Trying to dance the Depression away helped support a waning social dance scene. Dance marathons (“Dance till you Drop” sessions) offered prize money to desperate couples. Film musicals starring Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, plus the influx of Latin rhythms, helped keep people on the dance floor. In the latter half of the decade, came Swing, bringing a new dance to England with its Big Band sound. The Lindy Hop was named for Charles Lindbergh’s hop across the Atlantic.

 - **The 1960’s and 70’s – Back to the Modern Social Dance Scene**Both Rock and Latin (including the Cuban Bossa Nova) continued into the 60’s, but the most important dance was the American-born Twist craze, which made solo dancing the rage. It soon hit the UK. In the Twist there were no standardised steps and no hold, not even a partner is needed, just twisting movements of the body to music and miming, “stubbing out that cigarette”. The teens loved it for its simplicity and individuality and “over 40’s” loved it too. It was even danced by the Royals.

- **Now**  early years of 20th century many modern dances were invented (Foxtrot, One-Step, Tango, Charleston, Swing, Postmodern, Hip-hop, breakdancing and more) and the expansion of musical brought those dances into worldwide popularity.
